## **Description**
For this project we were asked to create a burger logger app that would create burgers, move burgers from eatable to devoured and delete burgers

## **Elements**

This app needed to connect to a database, log new burgers, update burgers, and delete burgers.

## **Usage**

![page](public/assets/img/burgers.jpg)
In the eatable category we have eatable burgers that have been added from the database.

![devoured](public/assets/img/devoured.jpg)
The devoured burgers can be moved from eatable to devoured onclick. 
The add burger form at the bottom allows you to add a new burger to the page

![addone](public/assets/img/addone.jpg)
If we add a burger
![new](public/assets/img/ultimeatum.jpg)
It will appear in the eatable category.
![more](public/assets/img/more.jpg)
You can add more than one new burger.
![move](public/assets/img/move.jpg)
You can move some to the devoured category.
![delete](public/assets/img/Delete.jpg)  
And delete the newly devoured burgers.
